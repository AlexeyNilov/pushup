# Training program

## Phase 1 Body preparation

* **Correct technique:** Learn how to move safely and efficiently
* **Mobility and Flexibility:** Enhance the range of motion in joints and muscles.
* **Core and Joint Stabilization:** Strengthen the core and stabilize joints to support overall movement and reduce injury risk.
* **Postural Alignment and Control:** Improve posture and control to ensure proper body mechanics during physical activity.
* **Muscular and Aerobic Endurance:** Build endurance in both muscles and cardiovascular systems to support longer and more effective workouts.

### Workout-Recover cycle

* 7 days cycle: 3 days workout, 4 days rest (w - r - w - r - w - r - r)
* Aim for the Supercompensation effect, try to reach your limit during 3rd workout day

### Warm-Up Strategy

1. **Gentle Mobility:** Light movements to loosen joints and promote fluid range of motion.
2. **Pulse Raiser:** Gradual aerobic activity to steadily elevate your heart rate and increase circulation.
3. **Specific Mobility:** Dynamic, targeted movements that enhance joint mobility and prepare muscles for the workout ahead.
4. **Final Pulse Raiser:** A final boost to heart rate and body temperature, priming your body for peak performance.
