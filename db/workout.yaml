# Intermediate level workouts
Pushup Pyramid: |
  Start with {start_rep} reps, increase by 2 reps each set until you hit {max_rep-20%} reps, then descend back down to {start_rep} reps.
  Rest for 45-60 seconds between sets.
Core and Pushup Supersets: |
  1. Start with pushups - 5 sets of {avg_rep} reps (rest 60 seconds between sets).
  2. Finish with planks - 3 sets, hold for 45 seconds.
Pushup Variations: |
  Rest 60 seconds between sets.
  1. Wide Pushups - 3 sets of {avg_rep} reps (works your chest).
  2. Diamond Pushups - 2 sets of {start_rep} reps (triceps focus).
  3. Normal Pushups - 1 set of {max_rep} reps.
Power Push-Up Tempo: |
  Get into a regular push-up position.
  1. Lower Slowly (4 seconds), count to 4 as you lower your chest towards the floor. Keep the movement controlled and steady.
  2. Pause and Hover (2 seconds).
  When you're a few inches above the floor, hold this position for 2 seconds. Engage your core and keep everything stable.
  3. Push Up Quickly (1 second).
  Push yourself back up as fast as possibleâ€”aim to reach the top in 1 second.
  Try for {avg_rep} reps per set, resting as needed between sets. Aim for 3-4 sets.
  Pro tip - If it's too hard, drop to your knees or perform on an elevated surface like a bench.
  This tempo will build endurance, stability, and explosive strength over time!
