Idea:
- "Form is Key: Keep your core tight, lower chest to the ground, and fully extend elbows."
- "Rest as Needed: Rest days are vital for muscle recovery and strength building."
- "After your workout, you need to relax your muscles and prevent stiffness. Focus on static stretches, holding each for 20-30 seconds."
- "Before each workout, you'll want to increase your heart rate and loosen up your muscles."
