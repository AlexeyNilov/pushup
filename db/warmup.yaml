  Single leg wall push-up: Similar to the wall pushups but on one leg.
Shoulder Muscles:
  Arm Circles: Stand tall with your arms extended out to the sides. Make small circles for 20 seconds, then switch to larger circles. Reverse the direction after 20 seconds.

Triceps:
  Shadow Boxing with Punch Extensions: Throw straight punches (jabs and crosses) by extending your arms fully, focusing on quick, controlled movements.
Core Stabilizers:
  Mountain Climbers: Start in a plank position. Drive one knee toward your chest, then switch quickly to the other side. Perform for 30 seconds.

  Standing Hip Circles: Slowly rotate your knee in a circular motion (like drawing circles with your knee) 10 times in one direction, then switch to the other direction.
Dynamic Stretching:
  Torso Twists: 2 sets of 15 twists each side. Stand tall and rotate your torso side to side to loosen your spine.
  Leg Swings: 2 sets of 15 swings per leg (forward and backward). Stand tall, hold a wall or support, and swing your leg gently.
Mobility and Activation:
  Cat-Cow Stretch: 1 minute. On all fours, arch your back (cow) and round it (cat), holding each for a few seconds.
  World's Greatest Stretch: 2 sets per side. Step into a deep lunge, bring your elbow down towards your foot, rotate and reach your arm toward the sky.
  Shoulder Taps: 2 sets of 20 reps. In a plank position, alternate tapping each shoulder with the opposite hand. This activates your core and shoulders.

  Floor Bridge: Perform the floor bridge by lying on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor; lift your hips toward the ceiling while squeezing your glutes, ensuring your shoulders remain pressed into the ground, creating a straight line from your knees to your shoulders.
